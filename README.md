# EmailBomb
A program to send nosense emails.
## How to use
Firstly, you need to put up your own SMTP server environment. I strongly recommand the hmailserver.

Secondly, access to config.py and reload your own config to make sure you can successfully access your own SMTP server.

Then, you can send some emails to the one you want to disturb.
